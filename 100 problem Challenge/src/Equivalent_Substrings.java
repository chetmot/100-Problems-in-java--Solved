//Question 39:
//Two strings A and B are equivalent (denoted by A∼B) if they have the same lengths and A can be transformed into B by performing the following operation zero or more times: choose a substring of A which contains '1' an even number of times and reverse this substring.
//
//You are given a binary string S. Find the number of different equivalence classes of the substrings of this string. In other words, find the smallest possible size of a set C of binary strings with the following property: for each non-empty string R which is a substring of S (including S itself), there is a string X∈C such that R∼X.
//
//Input Format
//
//The first and only line of input contains a single string S with length N.
//
//Constraints
//
//1≤N≤1,000
//
//S contains only characters '0' and '1’
//
//Output Format
//
//Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of equivalence classes among the substrings of the given string.
